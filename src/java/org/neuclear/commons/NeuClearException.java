 * $Log: NeuClearException.java,v $
 * Revision 1.1  2003/10/21 22:29:31  pelle
 * Renamed NeudistException to NeuClearException and moved it to org.neuclear.commons where it makes more sense.
 * Unhooked the XMLException in the xmlsig library from NeuClearException to make all of its exceptions an independent hierarchy.
 * Obviously had to perform many changes throughout the code to support these changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/02/08 20:55:03  pelle
 * Some documentation changes.
 * Major reorganization of code. The code is slowly being cleaned up in such a way that we can
 * get rid of the org.neudist.utils package and split out the org.neudist.xml.soap package.
 * Got rid of tons of unnecessary dependencies.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/01/18 18:12:30  pelle
 * First Independent commit of the Independent XML-Signature API for NeuDist.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2002/10/03 01:51:58  pelle
 * Bunch of smaller fixes for bugs found during deployment.
 * Also a bit more documentation.
 * I'm happy with this being called rev. 0.4
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2002/09/21 23:11:16  pelle
 * A bunch of clean ups. Got rid of as many hard coded URL's as I could.
 *
 * User: pelleb
 * Date: 05-Jun-02
 * Time: 13:05:46
 * To change template for new class use 
 * Code Style | Class Templates options (Tools | IDE Options).
