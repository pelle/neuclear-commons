Revision 1.4  2003/12/19 00:31:15  pelle
Lots of usability changes through out all the passphrase agents and end user tools.

Revision 1.3  2003/12/16 23:16:40  pelle
Work done on the SigningServlet. The two phase web model is now only an option.
Allowing much quicker signing, using the GuiDialogueAgent.
The screen has also been cleaned up and displays the xml to be signed.
The GuiDialogueAgent now optionally remembers passphrases and has a checkbox to support this.
The PassPhraseAgent's now have a UserCancellationException, which allows the agent to tell the application if the user specifically
cancels the signing process.

Revision 1.2  2003/11/21 04:43:41  pelle
EncryptedFileStore now works. It uses the PBECipher with DES3 afair.
Otherwise You will Finaliate.
Anything that can be final has been made final throughout everyting. We've used IDEA's Inspector tool to find all instance of variables that could be final.
This should hopefully make everything more stable (and secure).

Revision 1.1  2003/11/12 16:33:41  pelle
Idea missed checking this in during a refactoring.

Revision 1.1  2003/10/31 23:58:53  pelle
The IdentityCreator now fully works with the new Signer architecture.
