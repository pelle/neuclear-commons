Revision 1.1  2003/11/11 21:17:47  pelle
Further vital reshuffling.
org.neudist.crypto.* and org.neudist.utils.* have been moved to respective areas under org.neuclear.commons
org.neuclear.signers.* as well as org.neuclear.passphraseagents have been moved under org.neuclear.commons.crypto as well.
Did a bit of work on the Canonicalizer and changed a few other minor bits.

Revision 1.1  2003/10/29 21:16:28  pelle
Refactored the whole signing process. Now we have an interface called Signer which is the old SignerStore.
To use it you pass a byte array and an alias. The sign method then returns the signature.
If a Signer needs a passphrase it uses a PassPhraseAgent to present a dialogue box, read it from a command line etc.
This new Signer pattern allows us to use secure signing hardware such as N-Cipher in the future for server applications as well
as SmartCards for end user applications.
