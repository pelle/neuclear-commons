Revision 1.2  2003/12/26 22:51:17  pelle
Mainly fixes to SQLLedger to support the schema generated by the new EntityModel

Revision 1.1  2003/12/24 00:25:40  pelle
Created a kind of poor man's version of ofbiz.org's EntityEngine. It doesnt use xml to configure it, but code.
Should mainly be used to create tables. Can also insert rows, but hasnt been thoroughly tested.
At some point I will improve that part and add some kind of smart querying engine to it. Similar to EntityEngine. But I dont
need that myself right now.
SQLLedger now uses this to create its tables. It is not fully working yet, but will be shortly.
