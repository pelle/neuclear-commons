			<p>
				This is a collection of common tools and utilities used throughout the
                NeuClear framework. They concern them selves with all the little generalistic
                bits and pieces that dont quite fit neatly elsewhere.

            <p>
                This release is very quick after 0.3, but we deemed it necessary
                to move a bunch of crypto code from <a href="http://neuclear.org/id/">NeuClear ID</a>
                and <a href="http://neuclear.org/xmlsig/">NeuClear XMLSig</a> to here.
                If you are using any of the CVS modules as well as the latest release 0.10 of
                XMLSig please update to this release.
            </p>
