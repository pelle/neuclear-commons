			<p>
				This is a collection of common tools and utilities used throughout the
                NeuClear framework. They concern them selves with all the little generalistic
                bits and pieces that dont quite fit neatly elsewhere.

            <p>
                Panama City, 12th of December, 2004. We are happy to announce
                the 0.5 release of NeuClear Commons. Major new features are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Support for JNDI datasources</li>
                <li>Transaction support via <a href="http://jotm.objectweb.org">JOTM</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Main goal of this release is to support the latest <a href="http://neuclear.org/id/">0.8 release
                of NeuClear ID</a>.
                <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=90470">Download it today and join in the NeuClear revolution</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This release is very quick after 0.3, but we deemed it necessary
                to move a bunch of crypto code from <a href="http://neuclear.org/id/">NeuClear ID</a>
                and <a href="http://neuclear.org/xmlsig/">NeuClear XMLSig</a> to here.
                If you are using any of the CVS modules as well as the latest release 0.10 of
                XMLSig please update to this release.
            </p>
