            <p>
				This is a collection of common tools and utilities used throughout the
                NeuClear framework. They concern them selves mainly with Crypto, but also all the little generalistic
                bits and pieces that dont quite fit neatly elsewhere. It is not really intended as a
                library for use outside the NeuClear framework, as such it is currently not well documented.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of the crypto code provide some useful abstractions ontop of the often complex JCE architecture from Sun.
                If there is interest we will probably repackage it in the next version as neuclear-crypto and document it better.

            <p>
                This release is very quick after 0.3, but we deemed it necessary
                to move a bunch of crypto code from
                <a href="http://old.neuclear.org/id/">NeuClear ID</a>
                and
                <a href="http://old.neuclear.org/xmlsig/">NeuClear XMLSig</a> to here.
                If you are using any of the CVS modules as well as the latest release 0.10 of
                XMLSig please update to this release.
            </p>
